title: "SOLID Object Oriented Develpment" 
---

This post is just introducing, discussing Solid.  It is high level, defines the acronym, and my reactions to it.

hint: I like it a lot, and feel like maybe it was covered in one of my classes and I missed it.  IT covers a lot of what I've learned the hard way

note that I will be making a separate post for each letter, and discussing how I understand it as of this writing.
