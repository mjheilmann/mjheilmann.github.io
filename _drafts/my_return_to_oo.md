work dictats, yada yada.  What have I missed.  What will I miss from Elixir.  what was I a bit short on.

i will miss
  - Elixir is pure functional, no instancing at all, literally
  - despite age, tooling for testing and performance monitoring on C++ is ancient

what have I missed:
 - std::thread is so much easier than what I used to do! nice!
 - std::function lambda support, thats nice too!
 - smart pointers, these are pretty cool

what is missing:
 - a clear industry or community standart on testing, Mocking, etc
 - good habits like interface design and writing clean code are as absent as ever
