OK.  I just created a new blog by cloning barryclark/jekyll-now, and now I have a blog post to overwrite.  I wasn't prepared for this, but that never stopped me before.

I work in research, so I work on many different things, and typically before support pages and blog posts are written about the solutions.  But sometimes that never happens.  To fill the gap and help others behind me, here we go!
