title: Neglected Blog and Self.
---

Excuses incoming:  A lot has been going on, and I have neglected this blog.  Surprisingly, I have also neglected myself.  But as part of fixing what is wrong with me, I am also fixing this blog.  I have updated the about section, which was over 5 years old.  I had 2 posts after 2016, but one was an unpublished draft and the other is just a rant at the concept of using velocity to determine a team-members worth.

Since that writing, I have had the following changes in my life:

* Left UCF, I didn't see opportunity for growth
* Got a new job at Fanhero
* Cut my teeth being a "Full-Stack Developer" instead of just a polyglot developer, I still think that is a lousy, gatekeeping phrase.
* Learned Elixir, and it taught me many things
* Left Fanhero, I didn't see the company finding success
* Got a new job with Luminar Technologies
* Became a full-time C++ developer
* Became Tech lead
* Becoming Product Owner in a SAFe framework
* Learning AutoSAR and ASPICE

Theres a lot going on!  I'm not going to clean-slate though, I have stubbed out a number of post drafts covering some of my technical lessons learned over the past few years.

I may also post on some of my stress management strategies, assertiveness, and how I am coping with all of these changes.  Don't forget the whole pandemic either, I am working from home and I have kids that are also staying home.

So between occasional posts on what I am actively working through, and the stubbed posts, I think a post a week is pretty achievable.
