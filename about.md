I am a Software Engineer and Software Architect currently located in Central Florida.  I attended Washington State University Vancouver for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, graduating with a Mathematics minor in 2009.  I continued there for my Masters of Science degree in Computer Science in 2011.

I currently work for the University of Central Florida; specifically in the Institute for Simulation and Training.  I work closely with with local Army Research Lab branches on simulations and training effectiveness studies.  Pretty boring stuff really.

I'm more interested in the difference between Radial and Rotary internal combustion engines, or what people mean when they say Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors can't explode.  Perhaps the etymology of "Neither here nor there".  But that is - as they say - neither here nor there.
