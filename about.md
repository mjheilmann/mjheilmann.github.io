I am a Software Engineer and Software Architect currently located in Central Florida.  I attended Washington State University Vancouver for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, graduating with a Mathematics minor in 2009.  I continued there for my Masters of Science degree in Computer Science in 2011.

I currently work for the University of Central Florida; specifically in the Institute for Simulation and Training.  I work closely with with local Army Research Lab branches on simulations and training effectiveness studies.

### Topics and Interests

While I can hope all day that this blog will be an amazing masterpiece of technical reporting and detail; but as my interests are wide and varied, the posts will vary.

### Contact me

I can be reached through linkedin, github, and google+, though I am afraid I cant be bothered to figure that all out here just yet.
